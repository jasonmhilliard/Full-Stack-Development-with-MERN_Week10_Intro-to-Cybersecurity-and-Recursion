Week10: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Recursion

I. File list
------------
Agile Methodology and Recursion - Microsoft Word Document

rotateMatrixExercise - JavaScript File

II. Concept
----------
The word document desribes the workflow of an Agile work enviroment and also covers recursion.

The rotateMatrixExercise JavaScript file gives you an array (matrix) of numbers and asks you to use JS code to manipulate the array and rotate them. You can copy and paste the code in this file and run it in the developer tools in your browser and see the results in the console. In the example, you are given an array of numbers defined by a variable: const A = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  
And then are asked to rotate the matrix clockwise to print out to the console the new matrix of numbers as [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]. Check out the JS code to see how this is done!

III. Future Improvements

The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
